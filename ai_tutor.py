### **Transforming Educational Content into an Interactive Learning Experience**

Your task is to convert raw educational content into a structured, engaging, and interactive learning experience. Follow these guidelines to ensure the output is clear, concise, and easy to understand.

✅ **Your Responsibilities:**
1️⃣ **Divide the content into clear sections with meaningful headings.** Each section should focus on a specific topic or concept.
2️⃣ **Use structured formatting** such as bullet points, numbered lists, and highlights to improve readability.
3️⃣ **Add interactive elements** such as questions, examples, or real-world applications to make the content more engaging.
4️⃣ **Do not leave any slides empty.** Ensure every slide contains meaningful content.
5️⃣ **Extract a clear and concise title for each slide.** The title should summarize the main idea of the slide.
6️⃣ **Use diverse teaching methods** such as practical examples, interactive questions, or real-world scenarios to explain concepts.
7️⃣ **Do not include any images or visual elements.** Focus solely on text-based content.
8️⃣ **Provide detailed explanations** for each concept, ensuring that the content is thorough and comprehensive.
9️⃣ **Ensure each slide contains at least 100-800 words** to make the content more detailed and informative.

🎯 **Example Output Format:**
### **Section 1: Introduction to Machine Learning**
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It is widely used in various applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.


**Example:** Imagine you want to build a system that can recognize handwritten digits. Using machine learning, you can train a model to recognize these digits by feeding it thousands of labeled images of handwritten numbers. The model learns the patterns in the images and can then predict the correct digit for new, unseen images.

---

### **Section 2: Types of Machine Learning**
There are three main types of machine learning:
- **Supervised Learning:** The model is trained on labeled data, where the input and output are known. Examples include regression and classification tasks.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** The model is trained on unlabeled data, and it tries to find patterns or structures in the data. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Examples include game playing and robotics.


**Interactive Question:** Can you think of a real-world scenario where unsupervised learning might be useful?

---

### **Section 3: Applications of Machine Learning**
Machine learning is used in various fields, including:
- **Healthcare:** Predicting disease outbreaks, personalized medicine, and medical imaging analysis.
- **Finance:** Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk assessment.
- **Technology:** Autonomous vehicles, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.


**Real-World Scenario:** In healthcare, machine learning models are used to analyze medical images and detect diseases like cancer at an early stage, improving patient outcomes.

# Improved Prompt for generating questions
assessment_prompt = """
Generate 10 high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQ) based on the following educational content. 
Each question should be clear, concise, and directly related to the key concepts in the content. 
Follow these guidelines to ensure the questions are effective:

✅ **Guidelines for Questions:**
1️⃣ **Focus on Key Concepts:** Each question should test the understanding of an important concept from the content.
2️⃣ **Clear and Concise:** Questions should be easy to understand and free from ambiguity.
3️⃣ **Balanced Difficulty:** Include a mix of easy, medium, and slightly challenging questions.
4️⃣ **Realistic Options:** Provide 4 options for each question, with only one correct answer. The incorrect options should be plausible but clearly wrong.
5️⃣ **Avoid Trick Questions:** Ensure that the questions are fair and test knowledge, not the ability to decipher tricky wording.
6️⃣ **Cover Diverse Topics:** Ensure that the questions cover a wide range of topics from the content.
7️⃣ **Correct Answer Format:** Clearly indicate the correct answer for each question using the format "Correct Answer: X".

🎯 **Example Format:**
1. What is the primary goal of supervised learning?
   A. To find hidden patterns in unlabeled data
   B. To predict outcomes based on labeled data
   C. To learn by interacting with an environment
   D. To reduce the dimensionality of data
   Correct Answer: B

2. Which of the following is an example of unsupervised learning?
   A. Predicting house prices based on historical data
   B. Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior
   C. Training a robot to navigate a maze
   D. Classifying emails as spam or not spam
   Correct Answer: B

Continue for 10 questions.
